I have decided to release the source code of Open Idea Custom Firmware for educational purposes and maybe if people can continue my stuff for finishing this project.
It's licensed under the GPLv3 and I really wish you folks would respect it, and license derivative works under the same license.


This is a source code that has had to many overhauls and is no longer the most organised one around, so please don't be to hard on me, although I think I did a pretty good job compared to most of my source codes. It's methods for patching the VSH are at the least a bit odd, so please try the best you can on maintaining compatbility with Game Categories if you ever release something derived from it.
